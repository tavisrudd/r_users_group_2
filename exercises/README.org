* Essential Resources 
- type ? followed by a function name to see built-in help (function
  must be in scope)

- use help.search('a keyword') if you're not sure what to
  look for

- google !!!

- http://www.statmethods.net/index.html (or google quick-r) for intro material

* hello world
Start the R interpreter and print the string "hello world"

#+begin_src R
print("hello world") 
# this is a comment
#+end_src

* hello.world function
Create a function called hello.world that does what you did manually
in the previous exercise. 

#+begin_src R
# define it
hello.world <- function() { 
  print("hello world")
}
# <- is the assignment operator, like = in javascript

# call it 
hello.world()
#+end_src

* create an anonymous version of the same function
#+begin_src R
# define it, but don't call it
function() { print("hello world") }

# define and call it 
(function() { print("hello world") })()
# this is just like javascript!

# give it a name, how about "hello.world"
hello.world <- function() { print("hello world") }
hello.world()
#+end_src

* use Google to figure out what R's rules are for naming variables and functions
* hello(name) function
Create a variant of the previous function that accepts a `name`
parameter and prints "Hello Mary", "Hello Lamb", etc. 

Hint: you'll need to figure out how to concatenate/join strings

#+begin_src R
hello <- function(name) {
  print(paste("hello", name))
}
hello("Jill")

#+end_src

* hello(name) with a default argument
Give the `name` argument a default value.

#+begin_src R
hello <- function(name="Jack") {
  print(paste("hello", name))
}
hello()

#+end_src

#+results:
: hello Jack

* create a `vector` of the following integers and assign it to a variable
1,2,3,4
#+begin_src R
my.single.int <- 1234
my.vector.of.ints <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
#+end_src
* multiply each int by 5
#+begin_src R
my.single.int <- 1234
my.single.int * 5
my.vector.of.ints <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
my.vector.of.ints * 5
#+end_src
* create a `vector` of the following strings and assign it to a variable
"Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"

#+begin_src R
# 
my.string <- "blah"

my.vector.of.strings <- c("Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb")

#+end_src

* use help.search to find a function that can convert each element in that vector to uppercase 
* find a function that will give you the length of the vector
* figure out the syntax to get the third element in the vector
* create a function that applies another function to each element in a vector
* find a function that will create a sequence of integers
This is like the `range` function in Python.
* use that function and the `matrix` function to create a 4 x 5 matrix of the first 20 natural numbers
* figure out the syntax to get the matrix element at row 2, col 3
* multiply every element in the matrix by 3 
* find a function that gives you the dimensions of the matrix
* convert this matrix to a vector
* create a Boolean matrix of the same size 
... that indicates whether the elements in our first matrix are > 13
* use the Boolean matrix to take a subset of our first matrix
... where the condition is true
... and where it is false
* what are the type and dimensions of the subset
* figure out how to create a random sample of 100 integers
* take a random sample of five elements from your first matrix
* find a way to sort the result of that sampling
* create a `list` that contains the letters of English and 
... and their position in the alphabet as separate fields

hint: letters is a constant built-in to R
* find the built-in dataset `swiss` and the help information about it
* what are the `type`, `dimensions`, `structure`, and `dimension names` of this dataset
* figure out how to access each column of this dataset individually
* show the first and last six elements of this dataset
hint: there are built in functions that will do this for you
* what are the types of the columns in `swiss`
* create a subset of swiss that only includes the columns Catholic and Fertility
* create a subset only showing the regions that are at least 50% Catholic
* use the functions that Isabella mentioned to examine the swiss data
* look at the `airquality` built-in dataset and create a subset without the NA Ozone values removed
* plot the various dimensions of the airquality dataset
* advanced exercise
** work in groups to choose some line-based log data (like apache logs, syslog, etc.)
** use `awk`, `perl`, `sed` or similar to select a subset (match a regular expression) and output csv
** save the output into a csv file and then import into R
** use what you've learnt so far to explore, summarize and plot the data
